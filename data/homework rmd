#440 Reproducibility and Statistics Assignment Homework

<!-- This is an Rmd comment. -->
<!--
You can make comments several lines long by inserting
the text in between the the start and the end of the 
comment.

Comments are where I'll tell you what to do. You should
use the space directly below the comments to do what
the comment asks. You should also describe what you're
doing to make it obvious to the reader so they can
easily follow your logic in a fully reproducible way.
For any statistical tests you run, you should explain
the results in plain English and present the statistics
as you would in an APA style manuscript. For any symbols
you don't know how to use/can't use, feel free to use the name
instead (e.g. alpha)

<!-- Load the politics.csv data file. -->

> pols<-read.csv("politics.csv")


<!-- 
Check the structure.
subject, party, testtime, minwage, and sex need to be factors.
optimismscore and income should be integer and numeric vectors.
Fix any variables that aren't right.

<!-- Create a histogram of posttest optimism scores.
Feel free to use the default ugly settings since
we didn't cover how to do this in ggplot2. If
you're a real go-getter, see if you can figure
out how to make a prettier histogram with better
labels, etc. using ggplot2. -->

<!-- Run a Multiple Regression Analysis to see
whether you can predict someones posttest optimism
scores from their pretest optimism scores and party
affiliation. Create a figure that shows the distributions
of pre- and posttest optimism scores and sex and create
lines that best fit the data for both sexes regardless of
whether the lines are warranted based on the statistical
analyses-->
