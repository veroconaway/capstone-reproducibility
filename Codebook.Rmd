#Codebook for politics.csv

The data in politics.csv represent fabricated data obtained from an imaginary
experiment. In which participants were given a survey measuring their optimism
using 10 10-point Likert scale questions (higher is more optimistic). After
taking the optimism survey, they indicated whether or not they agreed with
the statement "The minimum wage should be increased." After completing these
initial measures, all participants watched 10 minutes of
*America's Funniest Home Videos*. After watching the videos they took the
survey again and again indicated whether they supported minimum wage increase.
Following this post test, all participants indicated which political party they
most affiliated with (i.e. Republican, Democrat, or Independent), what their
annual income was, and their sex.

In total, there were six variables.

* **subject**: The order the participant participated in the experiment (e.g. 1 = first)
* **party**: Political party affiliation (republican, democrat, or independent;
people claiming other party affiliations were excluded from the experiment).
* **testtime**: Which version of the test they took (i.e. pre- or post-videos).
* **optimismscore**: The score on the optimism survey for the corresponding testtime.
* **minwage**: Whether or not they supported increasing the minimum wage (yes or no).
* **sex**: the participants' sex (male or female).
* **income**: the participants' income in thousands of dollars.
